# Local Quantile Projections

Python module to estimate local quantile projections, and produce useful outputs for economists

Based on the QuantileReg package from statsmodels

Based on my conditional quantile sampling module (https://github.com/romainlafarguette/cqsampling)

The quantile uncrossing part is based on either:

Chernozhukov et al. (2010) /Quantile and Probability Curves Without Crossing/, Econometrica

Schmidt and Zhu (2016), /Quantile Spacings: A Simple Method for the Joint Estimation of Multiple Quantiles Without Crossing/
